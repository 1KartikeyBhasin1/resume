                Hey,
            
                I'm just someone who loves to code, listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/63kc63zz2gt4jf51akkl7ehem?si=02c6c1a446ca406a" target="_blank">music</a>, and watch movies. Drawing and designing stuff is also my jam. Coding is like solving puzzles for me. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably chilling with some good tunes or checking out the latest movies. Drawing lets me express myself, and I'm always doodling something fun.
            
                So yeah, that's me - into tech, music, movies, and drawing. Currently Studying in UPES, if you ever wanna talk about any of that stuff, just give me a shout!
            
                Take care.
            </p>

            <h1 class="hack">Hackathon</h1>
            On March 16th and 17th, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the CSI Hackathon 8.0. Alongside my talented team the "Fantastic Four," we embarked on a journey to create something innovative and impactful.

            Our project, "Personalized Itinerary Planning," aimed to revolutionize the way people plan their travels, offering tailor-made itineraries to suit individual preferences. As a team, we divided our responsibilities, and I delved into the frontend development and website design aspects of our project.
            
            The 30-hour hackathon tested our skills, teamwork, and creativity. In the initial round, we pitched our concept to the judges, showcasing our vision and strategy. Advancing to the next round, we presented our first draft of the frontend website, receiving positive feedback and encouragement.
            
            Despite the challenges and time constraints, we persevered and delved into refining our project further, particularly focusing on the database implementation. While we were unable to progress beyond the third round, the journey itself was immensely rewarding, filled with learning experiences and camaraderie.
